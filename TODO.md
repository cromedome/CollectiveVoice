# The Almighty TODO List

This file contains ideas for future functionality, testing & deployment.

For open issues and tasks under development, see the [CV-1 Development Project](https://github.com/knowmad/CollectiveVoice/projects/1) in GitHub.


## New Feature Ideas

* Add `/heath` path to CV.pm
* Make a11y-friendly
* Add support for Audio and Video testimonials
* Disable reviews once a feedback form has been submitted (idea being that we don't want user to be able to rate us publicly if they've provided feedback)


## Testing

* Create a Perl Critic test with Test::Perl::Critic <https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Perl::Critic>
* Add email testing support - see https://metacpan.org/source/GSG/Email-SendGrid-V3-v0.900.1/t/send.t
* Test with Firefox::Marionette <https://metacpan.org/pod/Firefox::Marionette>


## Deployment

* Dockerize
* Add support for HealthCheck - https://grantstreetgroup.github.io/HealthCheck.html
